# oscillograph

Oscillograph was my TCC back in 2013, you can read it annexed with the first release of the project.
I don't plan to active develop it but I don't like the ideia of this project dying.

Some points about the project:
* I've used this to learn C#, so the project is not so good writed.
* It only works to a set of examples that I didn't shared due CELESCÂ® copyrights.
* I wish I knew git at that time.
* In memoriam of Jacqueline G. Rolim by dear teacher and academic guide.
* Special thanks to my co-orientator Flavio Spolaor without his ideas and excitement this would not be possible.
